# Day 24

🎯 Day 24 – One Project a Day Until I Get Hired

Today’s mini project was a fun and simple number guessing game built entirely in Excel + VBA. The user types a number (1–100), hits the "Guess" button, and gets feedback like:

  - 📈 Too high

  - 📉 Too low

  - 🎉 Correct!

There's also a Reset button to generate a new random number.
On the screenshot, you can see the correct number for demo purposes — but in the real version, it’s hidden using a custom cell format. 😉

This one was a bit shorter than previous days, but still satisfying to complete a working game loop with basic logic, conditional feedback, and button controls.

✅ Skills Used:

  - Excel formulas

  - VBA scripting

  - UI with buttons

  - Basic game logic
